Inventory Management System utilizing JavaFX with Java. In this school project I implemented the Model View Controller (MVC) system design to develop a robust and easy to update inventory system. You can add parts to the system and associate the parts with finished products so business needs can be met regarding stock. This was not implemented with a database, which will be the first thing I add to this project if I will update it. The second thing would be responsiveness of the UI. As I am new with JavaFX I opted for anchor panes instead of more responsive containers like V-Box.
